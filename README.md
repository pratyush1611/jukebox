# Wi-Fi Jukebox v1.0.0

A web-based music player that runs on Android (via Termux) and lets people on the same Wi-Fi network add YouTube videos to a shared queue. Music plays through the Android phone's speakers.

## Features

### Core Features
- **YouTube Integration**: Add songs via YouTube URL or search
- **Shared Queue**: Real-time queue visible to all users on Wi-Fi network
- **Smart Playback Controls**: Play, pause, skip, seek with progress bar
- **Dual Add Options**: "Play Next" (priority) or "Add to Queue" (normal)
- **Auto-Downloads**: Organized music library in `~/storage/Music/Artist/Year Album/`
- **Rich Metadata**: Extracts artist, album, year, thumbnails from YouTube
- **SQLite Database**: Tracks all downloaded songs with metadata

### Intelligent Auto-Suggestions
- **Last.fm Integration**: Uses Last.fm API for music recommendations
- **Session-Aware**: Only suggests music during active listening sessions (3-hour window)
- **Smart Filtering**: Prefers music content (30sec-20min), avoids podcasts/tutorials
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Tracks suggested songs to avoid repeats
- **Personalized**: Based on your actual listening history

### User Interface
- **Visual Queue Separation**: Icons distinguish user-added (ðŸ‘¤) vs auto-suggested (ðŸŽµ) songs
- **Duration Display**: Shows song length for all queued tracks
- **Real-time Updates**: Queue refreshes every 2 seconds
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive design for phones/tablets
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows current song position and duration
